          It‚Äôs been some time since I last wrote you a letter, no better time
          than the present to add to our ledger.

          Today is the 20th of September 2025, and it has been eight weeks and
          one day since I asked you to be my girl, only five more days until
          it's been a full two months. In one of our most recent Candle app
          questions, I told you how being with you has reminded me of my
          capacity to show and express love, something I always knew I had but
          neglected for so long.

          <strong>What I See</strong>

        <p>
          Pouring out love from the heart is something I feel is so special, and
          we humans do it in so many different ways. The conversation we had
          earlier today made me feel like I might not have clearly articulated
          how the way you show me love makes me feel. I know it's not a
          competition and this is supposed to flow naturally, but I want to
          freeze time for a second so I can put into words some of what I have
          experienced and how you make me feel.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          You call me almost every single day now before you start your day. You
          tell me how your day started and show me what outfit you're wearing.
          That makes me feel like I have a partner in this world. We live in an
          extremely busy world where only married couples often get to see each
          other in the morning, but despite your crazy morning schedule you
          still call me. That makes a man who has spent most of his life feeling
          alone feel like he finally has a partner, someone special to share
          life with.

          I love how you not only welcome my affection, but also go the extra
          mile by fanning my flames when I'm burning bright in your presence,
          letting me show love without question. I‚Äôm going to touch more on how
          I display affection later, but I want you to know that your natural
          embrace of my instinct to show love makes the child in me, the one who
          experienced so much pain for living authentically, feel extremely
          proud that he never stopped wearing his heart on his sleeve, never
          stopped being himself. I cherish that I found this in you, and I
          really can‚Äôt wait to show you this affection in person.

          Those oogly eyes! I contemplated whether or not I was going to write
          this one here, but since when have you known me to pull a punch? The
          moments when you stare at me and all your eyes can say is, ‚ÄúI want
          you!‚Äù In those moments, you make me feel like I am the best and only
          man walking on this planet. I stare right back at you, and I know we
          want the same thing. It screams to me that this girl wants me naked,
          physically and metaphorically. I want you to know that I notice every
          micro action you take. I receive deeply within me the way you express
          this deep desire for connection with me, and I look forward to making
          every single fantasy come true.

          The sidekick who shows up for every mission. I mentioned your morning
          calls, but those mid-day calls, when you just want to be with me,
          deserve their own shoutout. I could‚Äôve just jumped out of the shower,
          heading to the store, and you‚Äôd call to tag along. Having someone be
          with you for the boring moments is new and special to me. Growing up
          with an older brother made me notice how much trust it takes to be
          someone‚Äôs sidekick, and knowing you‚Äôve chosen that with me makes me
          feel honored. It tells me you‚Äôre here for more than the good seasons;
          you‚Äôre present, and that means everything. I can‚Äôt stop picturing all
          the little adventures I want to share with you: the Starbucks coffee
          runs, the late-night McDonald‚Äôs drive-through trips, and driving out
          late at night to grab gas station snacks. I want to give you all of
          it.

          I can honestly go on forever, and I actually do intend to, just maybe
          not in this letter üòÖ. The way you trust me with stories about
          difficult moments in your past, how you empathize with the difficult
          stories from my childhood, and how you acknowledge the work I‚Äôve put
          into overcoming those experiences means so much. I guess what I‚Äôm
          trying to say is that I have my eyes wide open. I don‚Äôt only see your
          flaws and mistakes; I also see your love and the actions of your
          heart, and I am bathing in it all. I don‚Äôt want to close the tap.

          <strong>How I Feel</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The feelings I expressed this morning were quite revealing, and it
          took some time to truly understand the elements behind them. When we
          first started talking, I mentioned that my primary love language was
          physical touch. Over the past two months, through self-reflection,
          I‚Äôve realized that I probably have three love languages now: Quality
          Time, Physical Touch, and Words of Affirmation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Over the years, I‚Äôve transitioned from someone who only knew what they
          wanted out of life to someone who truly believes in their capacity to
          experience these great things. I‚Äôve done a lot of personal work, which
          has shifted my focus toward valuing deep, meaningful connections over
          pleasing the masses. Physical touch is still important to me, but I‚Äôve
          noticed it feels most fulfilling when I am deeply emotionally
          connected, and that connection grows through quality time. In other
          words, my ‚Äúcapacity‚Äù for meaningful physical touch is fueled by the
          time we spend deeply connecting.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Bringing this up helps me understand why I felt the way I did earlier
          today. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt feel connected to you, it‚Äôs that I felt
          we missed an opportunity to spend deep, quality time together. I
          deeply value all the ways we connect, but I‚Äôm especially drawn to the
          emotional richness that grows from our quality time. I get even more
          excited when I remember how both you and I are such deep souls,
          whether it‚Äôs through talking, exploring concepts, music, stories,
          experiences, or ideas together.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm sorry if the way I expressed my feelings earlier made you feel
          blamed or unappreciated. I know negative emotions can arise when
          people passionately express themselves, but I hope that by sharing
          this, we are better equipped to find more infinite ways to connect and
          better navigate difficult moments together in the future. I already
          know you and I have what it takes, and I would never want this to feel
          like a chore for us, rather, an endless stream of ways that we
          naturally show love to one another.

          <strong>How I Show</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          I just spent the last few seconds explaining to you how I feel, I now
          feel like it is only fitting that I show you how I show, which
          actually means, I show you how I express love. I'm sure by now you
          have gotten some sort of taste of what it's like to be with Mata, but
          since we are in the spirit of deep articulation, here we go‚Ä¶ I love
          like a giver. I love, love, love, and I give, give, give. That‚Äôs just
          who I am. I don‚Äôt keep score, I don‚Äôt ask first, I just give from my
          heart and think later. It‚Äôs the way I know how to love.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          I understand the risks that come with being that kind of person, being
          misunderstood, or even taken advantage of, but this isn‚Äôt something I
          do out of fear or anxiety. This is an intentional choice I‚Äôve made
          about how I want to live. I want love to be the foundation of the
          world around me, a space where giving and receiving happens naturally.
          That‚Äôs the universe I want to continue to create with the people
          closest to me.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          I know I'm always avoiding the use of the word relationship, but allow
          me to break the rules this one time. I believe relationships aren‚Äôt
          just about two people aligning; they‚Äôre also about showing up for each
          other continuously, and I‚Äôm here for that. So yes, I operate like I‚Äôve
          already put on the ring and now I'm just on this never ending
          rollercoaster or discovering love with you. We‚Äôve already been blessed
          with so many things that connect us naturally, the rest is about us
          showing up, together, for the rest of our lives.
